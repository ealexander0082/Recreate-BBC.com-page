<h2>Best fluffy Pancakes</h2>
<p>Look no further because a steaming stack of perfectly soft, Best Fluffy Pancakes are right here! Weekends will never be the same again!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups all purpose flour,</li>
  <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar,</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt,</li>
  <li>1 3/4 cups milk,</li>
  <li>1/4 cup butter,</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract,</li>
  <1i>large egg</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>

<li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
(The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).</li>

  <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.</li> 

<li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>

<li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>

  <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
